<h1>History of Manga and its Orgins</h1>
<p>Manga, or Japanese comics, has a long history that goes back hundreds of years. It started with early Japanese art like ukiyo-e, which are woodblock prints, and picture scrolls from the <i>12th century</i>. One famous example is the Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga, which showed animals acting like humans.</p>

<h3>Example of chōjū-jinbutsu-giga</h3>
<p>After World War II, manga became more like what we know today. A big reason for this was <strong>Osamu Tezuka</strong>, who is sometimes called the "God of Manga." In the 1950s, he created Astro Boy, a story about a robot boy, and changed the way manga was made by adding more emotion and exciting stories. His work helped manga become popular not just in Japan, but all over the world, with stories for everyone, from action to romance.</p>

<h3>Some of Tezuka's most famous characters</h3>
<p>By the 1960s and 1970s, manga had exploded in popularity across Japan. Different genres began to emerge, including <i>shōnen</i> (for young boys), <i>shōjo</i> (for young girls), <i>seinen</i> (for adult men), and <i>josei</i> (for adult women), each catering to different age groups and interests. This allowed manga to become a storytelling medium for everyone.</p>

<h3>Not to say shonen art cant also be extremly detailed but its not that gory and has less  adult topics. </h3>
